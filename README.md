# Sorting-algorithms

This is a site that contains 3 sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort)

Main page contains a menu and some general informations about sorting algorithms.

Each page dedicated to sorting algorithms contains three main parts:
  - A visual implementation of the sorting algorithm that shows in real time how the algorithm works. This also has two buttons, one for generating a new array and another one for sorting the array
  - A section where the sorting algorithm is detailed in depth
  - An implementation of the algorithm in C++
